<h1>NIST Framework-Based Response to Ransomware Attack - Simulation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I led a simulated ransomware incident response for a mid-sized financial institution. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I coordinated detection, containment, and recovery efforts while ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations (FFIEC, GLBA). The exercise demonstrated how structured response planning reduces operational disruption and strengthens resilience against ransomware threats.

<h2>Incident Overview</h2>

- **Incident Type:** Ransomware attack simulation<br>
- **Sector:** Financial services<br>
- **Impact:** Client financial records inaccessible; ransom note detected; encrypted servers<br>
- **Objective:** Apply NIST CSF functions to manage response, minimize business disruption, and ensure compliance

<h2>Outcome & Value </h2>

- Incident contained within 36 hours.<br>
- No ransom paid; systems restored from clean backups.<br>
- Customer disruption minimized.<br>
- Increased organizational confidence through structured, compliant response aligned with NIST CSF.
